# Mapping Recent Earthquakes: JS-Leaflet

![Map Demo](map_demo.gif)

This exercise makes use of data collected and published by the United States Geological Survey (USGS), the US federal agency responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of ecosystems and the environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. USGA scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

Te purpose of this project was to visualize data on the most severe earthquakes worldwide, calling data from an API that is collected and updated daily by the USGA. These types of visualizations allow us to better educate the public and other organizations in real-time, making quick use of data collected by large public agencies.
